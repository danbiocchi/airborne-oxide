Supercharging ArduPilot: A Rust-powered Flight Controller with Mavlink Integration

## Description

airborne-oxide is an ambitious Rust program aimed at creating a high-performance, safety-critical flight controller. By leveraging Rust's performance and memory safety features, we're building a robust alternative to traditional C/C++ implementations. This project integrates with ArduPilot's ecosystem and implements Mavlink protocol support, bridging proven open-source autopilot software with Rust's modern programming paradigms.

## Currently developing Features

- Rust-based implementation for improved performance and memory safety
- ArduPilot compatibility layer
- Basic Mavlink protocol integration
- Real-time scheduling for critical flight control loops
- Sensor data acquisition and fusion (IMU, GPS, Barometer)
- Simple PID controller for stabilization

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] ArduPilot HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in Rust
- [x] Mavlink message parsing and generation
- [ ] Core flight control loops

### Phase 2: Advanced Flight Features
- [ ] Advanced flight modes (Loiter, RTL, Auto)
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance using computer vision
- [ ] Path planning algorithms
- [ ] Geofencing capabilities

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Full ArduPilot parameter system compatibility
- [ ] Custom Ground Control Station in Rust
- [ ] Simulation environment for testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on various hardware

### Phase 4: Optimization and Expansion
- [ ] WASM module for in-browser flight control customization
- [ ] Machine learning integration for adaptive control
- [ ] Support for various flight platforms (multirotor, fixed-wing, VTOL)

## Development Environment Setup

To get started with contributing to airborne-oxide, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Set up the Development Environment
   a. Install Rust and Rust Rover IDE
    - Download and install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
    - Follow the installation prompts, ensuring Rust is added to your system PATH
    - Download and install Rust Rover IDE from JetBrains website
    - Open Rust Rover IDE and ensure it recognizes your Rust installation

   b. Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
    - Download from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
    - Run the installer, ensuring "Add path to environment variable" is checked
    - Verify the installation by running: `arm-none-eabi-gcc --version`

2. Install Hardware Interfacing Tools
   a. Install OpenOCD
   b. Install ST-Link drivers
   c. Install FTDI drivers

3. Set Up the Project
   a. Create a new project in Rust Rover IDE
   b. Configure the project for embedded development (update Cargo.toml and .cargo/config.toml)

4. Configure the Build System
   a. Add the thumbv7em-none-eabihf target:
      ```
      rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
      ```

5. Write Your Program
6. Build the Project
7. Prepare for Flashing
8. Flash the Program
9. Verify and Debug

For detailed instructions on each step, please refer to our [Development Setup Guide](docs/dev_setup_guide.md).

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danbiocchi/airborne-oxide.git

# Change into the project directory
cd airborne-oxide

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Usage

As airborne-oxide is currently in the early stages of development, there are no functional components available for end-users at this time. However, here's what you can do:

For Developers:
- Explore the codebase to understand the project structure.
- Check the docs folder for design documents and architectural plans.
- Look for TODO comments in the code for areas that need work.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to airborne-oxide! Here's how you can help:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please ensure your code adheres to our style guide and passes all tests.

## Getting Involved

While we're not ready for flight tests, we welcome contributions in:

1. Rust implementation of ArduPilot HAL
2. Mavlink protocol integration
3. Flight dynamics modeling
4. Safety-critical RTOS design in Rust

Let's redefine flight control systems with the power of Rust! ü¶Ä‚úàÔ∏è
