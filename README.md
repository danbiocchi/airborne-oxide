Supercharging ArduPilot: A Rust-powered Flight Controller with Mavlink Integration

## Description

airborne-oxide is an ambitious Rust program aimed at creating a high-performance, safety-critical flight controller. By leveraging Rust's performance and memory safety features, we're building a robust alternative to traditional C/C++ implementations. This project integrates with ArduPilot's ecosystem and implements Mavlink protocol support, bridging proven open-source autopilot software with Rust's modern programming paradigms.

## Current Features

- Rust-based implementation for improved performance and memory safety
- ArduPilot compatibility layer
- Basic Mavlink protocol integration
- Real-time scheduling for critical flight control loops
- Sensor data acquisition and fusion (IMU, GPS, Barometer)
- Simple PID controller for stabilization

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] ArduPilot HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in Rust
- [x] Mavlink message parsing and generation
- [ ] Core flight control loops

### Phase 2: Advanced Flight Features
- [ ] Advanced flight modes (Loiter, RTL, Auto)
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance using computer vision
- [ ] Path planning algorithms
- [ ] Geofencing capabilities

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Full ArduPilot parameter system compatibility
- [ ] Custom Ground Control Station in Rust
- [ ] Simulation environment for testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on various hardware

### Phase 4: Optimization and Expansion
- [ ] WASM module for in-browser flight control customization
- [ ] Machine learning integration for adaptive control
- [ ] Support for various flight platforms (multirotor, fixed-wing, VTOL)
